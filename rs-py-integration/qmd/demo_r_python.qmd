## Python chunk (runs)

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
arr = np.arange(5)
df = pd.DataFrame({"x": arr, "y": arr * 2})
df.head()

## R chunk (placeholder, not executed yet)
This shows the R engine slot. We set `eval: false` so it renders even if R isn't configured yet.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# summary(cars)
# sessionInfo()
