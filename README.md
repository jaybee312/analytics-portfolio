# Analytics Portfolio

This portfolio showcases end-to-end analytics frameworks Iâ€™ve built and refined in professional settings, rebuilt here in open-source form.  
It includes forecasting pipelines, marketing attribution frameworks, anomaly detection alerts, and interactive business intelligence dashboards.  

The goal: **demonstrate depth in analytics engineering, reproducible workflows, and communication through polished reports.**
